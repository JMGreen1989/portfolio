I am looking to apply my knowledge of front and back-end skills to the tech industry. I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, SQL, Node.js, and React. My time in the Communications industry has taught me the value of conceptualizing ideas, and Iâ€™m looking to bring those past lessons along with my web development experience to a well established, innovative organization.        </p>
